# Coin Plate
A device to store entropy by OrangeSurf (https://orange.surf)

# Summary of device 
A steel plate with coin sized holes ('the restraining plate') is placed on top of a solid plate ('the base plate') creating a number of recesses. 
Coins are scattered on the assembly, dropping into the circular recesses which provide radial restraint. 
A third plate with holes smaller than the coins ('the cover plate') is put on top of the assembly which provides axial restraint. 
The three plates are permanently assembled using nine hex head bolts and nine shear nuts. 
A fourth plate ('the shield plate') is placed on top of the assembly and one or more thumb screws are used to hide the coins from view.

## Entropy Storage
A bitcoin wallet is generated from an entropy source. 
Some users provide this entropy using coin flips.
If this entropy is stored it is possible to recover the wallet from this entropy (provided this is the only entropy source used).
This tool simplifies the generation and storage of entropy.

## Assembly Steps

The solid steel plate ('the base plate') is placed on a flat surface.
